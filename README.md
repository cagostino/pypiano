#This is my README
#This is a simple python piano which uses the pyglet library as well as downloaded piano wav sounds for the notes from middle C
#to tenor C.
#use keys A through K to play the natural notes and W,E, T, Y,U to play the sharps/flats.
#I lifted the key pictures from the Greenfoot piano project but the code here is my own.
