#This is my README
#This is a simple python piano which ues the pyglet library as well as downloaded piano wav sounds for the notes from middle C
#to tenor C.
#Anyway, I hope you enjoy. Must have the pyglet library downloaded for it to work and JACK configured correctly.
#use keys A through K to play the natural notes and W,E, T, Y,U to play the sharps/flats.
